Formed by centuries of wind and water erosion in desert sediments, the gorge stretches for about two kilometers. Its towering walls rise up to 30 meters in places, creating a dark and narrow passage that inspired the name 'Zolomat' (meaning 'darkness'). Inside, the air is cooler and shaded, and the echo of the wind between the cliffs gives the place a mysterious atmosphere. Access to the strait is challenging and requires a guide and suitable off-road vehicles, as it lies within a protected area. The surrounding region is home to diverse desert flora and fauna, making a visit both an adventurous and unique eco-tourism experience in central Iran."

Although the northern section of the building has been destroyed, the southern part still preserves a hall, two iwans, and two rooms. Its location near Qasr-e Bahram Caravanserai highlights its role as part of the royal desert travel network.

The palace was supplied with fresh water through an aqueduct system connected to nearby springs, making it a rare oasis in the arid desert. The building once included a central courtyard, iwans, and multiple chambers, though much of it has been damaged over time. Today, only parts of the walls and foundations remain, but the site still reflects the architectural style of desert palaces and the strategic importance of water management in Iran’s central plateau.

Stretching for several kilometers across the desert, the road was constructed with carefully laid stone slabs to provide a stable path for caravans, royal hunting parties, and travelers crossing the harsh terrain. Its engineering reflects the ingenuity of Persian builders in adapting to desert conditions, ensuring durability against wind and sand erosion. The road passes near Siah Kuh Mountain and was strategically aligned with natural water sources and caravanserais, forming part of the Safavid network of desert infrastructure.

Although no longer operational, the remains of the Cotton Factory stand as a reminder of Garmsar’s agricultural and industrial history. Today, it is recognized as a cultural landmark, attracting visitors interested in Iran’s economic heritage and the evolution of industry in the desert regions."
